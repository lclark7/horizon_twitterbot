# horizon_twitterbot
This is a repository to share the code for my [@Color2Horizons](https://twitter.com/Color2Horizons), which posts every 3 hours on Twitter.

This is a Twitter Bot I created using [Cheap Bots, Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/) for Creative Coding with [@zachwhalen](https://twitter.com/zachwhalen).

This bot generates abstract images using SVG. It was inspired by both [@softlandscapes](https://twitter.com/softlandscapes) and [@ManyShirts](https://twitter.com/ManyShirts). How you interpret these images is up to the beholder. This bot is capable of producing an undefinable number of possible variations when a calculation was attempted with Dr. Whalen's [Colaboratory Tracery Calculator](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yV0V54Le5QYyi4ytiy3buZFjfHYQX5pe?usp=sharing). Please open the calculator and run the cells to view the possible variations, because the number is astronomically large and refuses to be converted into scientific notation.

I decided to create an image bot because I wanted to do something interesting and unique for this project. Most of my classmates appeared to be creating bots that generate prompts or jokes, however I wanted to take this project a step further. SVG proved to be the hardest thing about coding this bot, however I believe it turned out good in the end because it has produced some very beautiful abstract images and gradients. My overall goal was to create a working Twitter Bot capable of producing unique content, and I'm proud to say it looks like I went above and beyond that!
