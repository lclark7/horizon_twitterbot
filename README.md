# horizon_twitterbot
This is a repository to share the code for my [@Color2Horizons](https://twitter.com/Color2Horizons) Twitter Bot.

This is a Twitter Bot I created using [Cheap Bots, Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/) for Creative Coding with [@zachwhalen](https://twitter.com/zachwhalen).

This bot generates abstract images using SVG. It was inspired by both @softlandscapes() and @ How you interpret these images is up to the beholder. This bot is capable of producing an undefinable number of possible variations when a calculation was attempted with Dr. Whalen's [Colaboratory Tracery Calculator](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yV0V54Le5QYyi4ytiy3buZFjfHYQX5pe?usp=sharing). Please open the calculator to view the possible variations, because the number is astronomically large.
